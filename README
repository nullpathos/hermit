Hermit
------
Application launcher for GNU/Linux.

A simple tabbed window shows icons that will launch commands specified by .desktop files found in /usr/share/applications and user defined locations.

License

You are free to what you will with the hermit code but be aware that the imported libraries on which hermit depends each have their own licence.

Requirements / dependencies
---------------------------
python 2.7
python-gtk2
python-keybinder, use your distribution repositories or https://github.com/engla/keybinder
other python libraries: os, glib, shlex, lxml, syslog

Usage
-----
It's just one python script, download it, run it (use python or change permissions and execute).
By default, hermit will appear after pressing Super_R (right Meta key).

It will create an XML file of settings in ~/.config/hermit/

Create an XML file tabs.xml (see included example_tabs.xml) in the same directory to specify your own choice of .desktop launchers. (restart hermit to load)

Change settings directly in the XML file (needs restart) or using the last tab, named 'Hermit'.

Example Openbox integration
---------------------------
Add to the end of ~/.config/openbox/autostart :

python /wherever_you_saved_it/hermit.py &
xdotool behave_screen_edge --delay 0 --quiesce 500 left exec --sync xte "key Super_R" &

This will show hermit when your mouse pointer touches the left screen edge by simulating a press of the hotkey, in this case Super_R.
You'll have to install xdotool and xautomation (which contains the xte command) yourself.

Future stuff
------------
* More comprehensive settings, including a hotkey chooser.
* User defined tabs/launcher editor.
* Support for programs that require a terminal.
